The K5UTD Amateur Radio Club works to promote amateur radio within UTD and the greater Richardson area.  We participate in contests, swap meets, and area radio projects.

We maintain the 145.430- (pl110.9) repeater, and have a shack in the Engineering and Computer Science building on the UT Dallas campus.

Feel free to [drop us a line](mailto:k5utdarc@gmail.com) or follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/k5utd/). We also [have a Discord](https://discord.gg/JxJ3jHrKjN).
