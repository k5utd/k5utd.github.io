Welcome! 

The K5UTD Amateur Radio Club is holding regular meetings during the Spring 2025 semester every Thursday at 18:00 (6:00 PM). Meetings will occur in the K5UTD Radio Shack at [ECSN 3.116](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1772#!m/543069?share).

Each weekly meeting will be themed around different aspects of amateur radio experimentation.

- Get hands-on experience operating amateur equipment and make contact with other amateur radio operators around the planet.
- Design and conduct amateur radio experiments utilizing resources in RF design and radio communication.
- Access our workbench materials and build something of your own, using club test and measurement equipment.

You do not need to be personally licensed to engage with our club activities. We also operate the K5UTD station callsign during meetings, so you can get on the air!

More information can be found by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JxJ3jHrKjN).

#### How do I study?

[HamStudy](https://hamstudy.org/) is an interactive study tool with dedicated guides, explanations, and resources for the hobby.

For a study guide, we recommend the [No Nonsense Study Guide](https://www.kb6nu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2022-no-nonsense-tech-study-guide-v2-20230204.pdf) by Dan Romanchik. Here is a livestream recording of the author's [1-day class](https://www.youtube.com/live/dIAppQPMznY) for getting the Technician Class License.

The question pools these resources are based on are made publicly available by the FCC, with more information provided by the [ARRL](http://arrl.org/question-pools).
