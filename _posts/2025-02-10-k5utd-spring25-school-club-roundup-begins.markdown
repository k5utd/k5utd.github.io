K5UTD is back again competing in the Spring ARRL School Club Roundup radio contest!

We get 24 hours throughout this week to operate and make QSOs with school clubs around the United States. 

Last semester, we placed second with 434,232 points.

- 1332 total radio station contacts
- 51 unique states
- 45 school radio clubs
- 21 DXCC Countries
- 11 amateur radio clubs
- 7 Canadian provinces

Help us connect with school clubs again this semester!

Ask in the `#meeting-plans` channel in Discord and stop by our radio shack in room [ECSN 3.116](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1772#!m/543069?share) to practice making contact with radio stations (QSOs) around the planet!
