K5UTD has finished competing in the Fall ARRL School Club Roundup radio contest!

We had 24 hours throughout this past week to operate and make QSOs with school clubs around the United States. 

This semester, we placed second with 434,232 points.

- 1332 total radio station contacts
- 51 unique states
- 45 school radio clubs
- 21 DXCC Countries
- 11 amateur radio clubs
- 7 Canadian provinces

Thank you for helping us connect with school clubs this semester!

Ask in the `#meeting-plans` channel in Discord and stop by our radio shack in room [ECSN 3.116](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1772#!m/543069?share) to practice making contact with radio stations (QSOs) around the planet!

The next School Club Roundup event is in February 2025. More information available on the [ARRL SCR Contest](https://www.arrl.org/school-club-roundup) page.
